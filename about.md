Joseph Bridges is a recent graduate from the University of Texas at Austin with a B.S. in Mathematics and a minor in Philosophy. As an undergraduate, Joseph 
was a part of the College of Natural Science's Directed Reading Program, where he performed research on cellular automata. His personal research and coursework 
has also focused on set theory. Now that he has graduated, Joseph seeks to apply the quantitative skills he learned in his major and synthesize them with the ethical and 
philisophical ideas that he learned in his minor, ideally in a business setting. Outside of the classroom, Joseph can be found lifting weights, exploring Austin through Pokemon GO, 
and spending time with his friends and family.
